 <h1>The Best Movies According to Earl</h1>

 <h2>My current top three movies of all-time</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Rose Red by: Stephen King</h3>
 <p>This is my favorite paranormal horror movie. The time Stephen King put into developig his characters and the perfect amount of beauty and creepyness he put into the move was great. Plus, very few jump scares that still come to an end with you feeling scared it could be real.</p>

 <h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
 <p>This movie is easily one of the first stepping stones to my love for car culture. Especially my love for both American Muscle and JDM. I was never the kid the only like Brian's Skyline or Dom's Charger (Dont get me wrong, a 68 is better than a 69). I was the kid that wanted both the Supra and the Charger.</p>

 <h3>The Santa Clause</h3>
 <p>I love watching The Santa Clause every year. It's one of my favorite things to do with my family. Kick back, enjoy some hot chocolate, and watch the best holiday movie of all time</p>

 <hr />
 <h2>Runner Ups</h2>

 <h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
 <p>Do I really have to explain this one. If you know, you know. If you don't, you need to watch it...</p>
  <h3>Coraline</h3>
  <p>Same as the one above this. If you havn't seen it, you just have to and you'll know why its' here</p>
